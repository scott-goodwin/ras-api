[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmrc/ras-api.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hmrc/ras-api) [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/hmrc/releases/ras-api/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/hmrc/releases/ras-api/_latestVersion)

Check if an pension scheme member is a resident in Scotland for tax purposes. 

If you’re a pension scheme administrator, you need to know this to make the correct relief at source claims.


Before You Start
----------------

You’ll need the pension scheme member’s name, date of birth and National Insurance number.


Description
-----------

Find out if a scheme member pays tax in Scotland or in the rest of the UK, to tell you the rate of tax to use for their relief at source contributions. 

From 1 January to 5 April each year you will get currentYearResidencyStatus and nextYearForecastResidencyStatus within the response json. 

From 6 April to 31 December each year you will only get currentYearResidencyStatus within the response json. 


Testing Approach
----------------

You can use the sandbox environment to [test this API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/testing).
It does not support [stateful behaviour](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/testing/stateful-behaviour),
but you can use the payloads described in the resources to test specific scenarios.

Please refer to the service [schemas](https://github.com/hmrc/ras-api/tree/master/resources/public/api/conf/1.0/schemas) to create additional payloads.

Requirements
------------

All end points are User Restricted (see [authorisation](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation)). Versioning, data formats etc follow the API Platform standards (see [the reference guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide)).

The API makes use of HATEOAS/HAL resource links. Your application does not need to store a catalogue of all URLs.

You can dive deeper into the documentation in the [API Developer Hub](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/ras-api/1.0).

This version of the API is in development and is very likely to change.

This service is written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and [Play](http://playframework.com/), so needs a [JRE to](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/overview/index.html) run.
